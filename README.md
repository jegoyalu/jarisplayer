##Be Free!

Searching for an flv player that could be used freely in all aspects and open source was
a hard job. So I just decided to work on a basic player that had the most important
features found in others players.

Thats the story of how Jaris was born.

* Aspect ratio switcher
* Fullscreen support
* Http pseudostreaming support
* Basic RTMP streaming support
* Poster image
* Volume control
* Seek control
* Display time

* Add a link to your logo
* Change position of logo
* Hide controls on fullscreen
* Custom control colors

* Mp3 support


##License

Jaris is licensed under GPL and LGPL, meaning that you could use it commercially.
What we ask for is that any improvements made to the player should be taken back to jaris flv website
so that any one could enjoy the new improvements or features also. In this way everyone could
help to maintain an up to date tool that adapts to todays multimedia demands.
Using github you can fork the project, work on your changes, and send a pull request.

Enjoy a totally free player ;-)

##Compiling from source

Install [haxe](http://haxe.org/) change to the directory where jaris sources reside
and run:

  haxe build.xml

JarisFLVPlayer.swf will be generated on the **bin** directory which you can embed in
your web sites as integrate as part of other projects.
