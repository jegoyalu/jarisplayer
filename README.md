## Be Free!

Searching for an flv player that could be used freely in all aspects and open
source was a hard job. So I just decided to work on a basic player that had the
most important features found in others players.

Thats the story of how Jaris was born.

## License

Jaris is licensed under GPL and LGPL, meaning that you could use it commercially.
What we ask for is that any improvements made to the player should be taken back
to jaris flv website so that any one could enjoy the new improvements or
features also. In this way everyone could help to maintain an up to date tool
that adapts to todays multimedia demands. Using github you can fork the project,
work on your changes, and send a pull request.

Enjoy a totally free player ;-)

## Compiling from source

Install [haxe](http://haxe.org/) change to the directory where jaris sources
reside and run:

```sh
  haxe build.xml
```

JarisFLVPlayer.swf will be generated on the **bin** directory which you can
embed in your web sites as integrate as part of other projects.
